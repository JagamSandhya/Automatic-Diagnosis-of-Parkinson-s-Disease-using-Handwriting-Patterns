# Automatic-Diagnosis-of-Parkinson-s-Disease-using-Handwriting-Patterns
This project explores the connection between Parkinson's disease and changes in handwriting, spiral drawing, or waveforms as potential indicators of motor dysfunction. By analyzing these patterns, it aims to assess motor symptoms like tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia.


Abstract: -Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neuro-degenerative syndrome characterized by motor and non-motor signs, and early detection is crucial for effective intervention. This paper presents a novel approach for PD detection using computer vision and machine learning techniques applied to Spiral-Wave handwriting analysis. The dataset comprises frontal handwritten images obtained through the Spiral-Wave test, capturing subtle motor control differences. Our methodology involves resizing images to a standardized 200x200pixels, converting them to grayscale, and applying thresholding for improved feature abstraction. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is employed to capture shape and texture information. The development of a strong approach for deriving significant features from Spiral-Wave handwriting patterns and the usage of machine learning classifiers for precise PD analysis are the two main goals of this work. The emphasis is on using Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifiers for Spiral and Wave pictures, respectively, in conjunction with the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) approach for feature extraction. For Spiral images, a Random Forest Classifier is utilized, achieving an accuracy of 86.67%. The classifier's interpretability is enhanced through an analysis of feature importance, revealing critical HOG features for distinguishing between healthy and PD-afflicted patterns. The Wave images are classified using a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) model, attaining an accuracy of 76.67%. Performance metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, offer a nuanced assessment of the KNN model's capabilities.
